# Rui's dotfiles

Dotfiles for me. Here be draggons!

## What's in it?

* [Sensible macOS defaults](./system/macOS/defaults.sh), most of them taken from [mathiasbynens' dotfiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/master/.macos)
* My [bin](./bin), with lots of automation scripts
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), which is an amazing command-line fuzzy finder
* A [git config](./git/gitconfig) and a bunch of [custom git commands](./bin) that improve my quality of life
* [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) as the core text editor. If you like vim, consider [helping children in Uganda](https://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php)
* [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) for
  finding things in files
* [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) as a terminal multiplexer, useful for saving project state and switching between
  projects
* [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) as the default shell with a vanilla setup and git in prompt
* Other tools can be found [here](./system/macOS/brew.sh)
